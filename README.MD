Open [http://localhost:3001/api/notes](http://localhost:3001/api/notes) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run frontend`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### This app uses Heroku as a deployment environment (no database, just node.)
